# Hotel Booking System
   
## Description

### The Hotel Booking System is a Java-based application designed to manage hotel room reservations. It allows users to search for available rooms, make bookings, view reservation details, and manage customer information. The system provides functionalities for both hotel staff and guests, including checking in, checking out, and updating booking details. It uses object-oriented principles to organize data into classes such as Room, Booking, ensuring a modular and efficient structure. With a user-friendly interface and database integration, the system streamlines hotel operations and enhances customer experience.
